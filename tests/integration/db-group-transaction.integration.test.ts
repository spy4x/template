/**
 * Proves HANDOFF.md trap 5 against the real class `apps/api/services/db.ts`'s `DbService`
 * extends: `AppDbBase.group` must be built fresh on every access, not cached on the
 * instance, because `DbServiceBase.begin()` derives its transactional clone with
 * `Object.create(this)` and rebinds `sql` on the clone - a repository built once and
 * reused would keep pointing at the pool client instead of the transaction handle, and a
 * write made through it inside `begin()` would commit outside the rollback it was supposed
 * to be part of.
 *
 * This test imports `AppDbBase` itself rather than a lookalike class defined here. An
 * earlier version of this file defined its own `TestDb` with the same `get group()`
 * shape, and a reviewer showed that guards nothing: caching `group` in the real
 * `AppDbBase` (then still inline in `DbService`) left that copy, and this test, green -
 * only the e2e sign-up flow went red. `tests/integration/db.integration.test.ts` covers
 * the same `begin()`/cache-deferral mechanics but never constructs a `group`-shaped
 * repository, so it cannot catch this regression either. See the PR body for the red/green
 * run against `AppDbBase` itself that demonstrates this test now does.
