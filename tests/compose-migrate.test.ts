 * Holds `infra/compose/compose.shared.yml` to the deploy's migration order: the one-shot `migrate`
 * service applies pending migrations, and every other service built from the API's Dockerfile
 * (the API, the worker) starts only after it exits with 0. Without that order a deploy with a new
 * migration serves traffic on the old schema (spy4x/template#113). Only this file is read: an
 * override file that changes these services with `!reset` or `!override` is not covered.
