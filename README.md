Create your repository from it, fill in the env file, and you start with a product that already
has accounts, a second factor, tenancy and a place for background work. A new user signs up and
gets an account, a session and a first group in one database transaction. Groups are the only
tenancy boundary, so the same membership checks and roles cover a person's own data and
shared workspaces.

It exists because every SaaS MVP needs the same groundwork before its first feature. The reusable
parts live here and in the published [`@spy4x/*`](https://jsr.io/@spy4x) packages; product rules
stay out.

**Status:** work in progress, moving to the target architecture in
[ADR 001](docs/decisions/001-deno-platform-template.md). Sign-up, sign-in with TOTP, groups with
members, roles, invitations and ownership transfer, billing per member, notes (the reference
aggregate), the outbox worker and the public website work today, and the SPA works offline
([docs/offline.md](docs/offline.md)). Parts of the worker are not built yet. Details in
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#migration-status). The live demo runs at
https://template.antonshubin.com, its website at https://template-mpa.antonshubin.com.

## Quick start

```sh
cp infra/envs/.env.example infra/envs/.env
```

Before going on, fill in the secrets in `infra/envs/.env` (`KV_PASSWORD` is the Valkey password;
Valkey and the API both refuse to start without it, `openssl rand -hex 24` makes one). It runs on
Docker; to use Podman, set `CONTAINER_PROVIDER=podman` (`proxy:start` and `proxy:stop` still call
Docker).

```sh
deno task vapid-key:create   # web push keys → infra/configs/vapid.json
deno task proxy:start        # Traefik
deno task dev                # Postgres, Valkey, MinIO, API, worker, SPA, Loki, Prometheus, Grafana
```

Then open `http://<DOMAIN>` from the env file: http://app.localhost with the values in
`infra/envs/.env.example`.

Promtail, node-exporter and cAdvisor watch the whole host, so they are off by default. Set
`COMPOSE_PROFILES=host-monitoring` in the env file to start them too.

To try the MPA in Compose, see "The SPA and the MPA" below. Stop the proxy with
`deno task proxy:stop`. Compose applies pending migrations on every start, in the one-shot
`migrate` service that the API and the worker wait for; a failed migration stops the start. To apply
them from the host instead, for an API run outside Compose, use the values from your `.env` and the
port Compose publishes:

```sh
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1 DB_PORT=5432 DB_USER=<user> DB_PASS=<password> DB_NAME=<name> deno task db:migrate
```

To start again from an empty development database, run `ENV=dev deno task db:reset` with the same
values (plus the seed's `AUTH_PEPPER` and `SEED_PASSWORD`). It drops the database, migrates it and
seeds it, after you confirm; `--yes` skips the question. It refuses unless `ENV=dev`, `DB_HOST` is
`localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `db`, and `DB_NAME` differs from the one in `infra/envs/.env.prod`. A
missing or unreadable `.env.prod` also refuses; on a machine without one, add `--no-prod-check`.

To add a demo user `demo` who owns a group, run `deno task db:seed` with the same values plus
`AUTH_PEPPER` (the API's) and `SEED_PASSWORD` (the demo user's password, 8 to 50 characters).

<summary>How the parts fit together</summary>

<img src="docs/architecture.svg" alt="Architecture diagram. Clients: apps/spa, a Preact and Vite PWA with sign-up, sign-in, TOTP and profile, talks to apps/api over REST and WebSocket; a Dexie offline store keeps the last notes and groups and queues writes made offline. apps/mpa is the public website on Fresh, server-rendered, calling the API only for the newsletter. Servers: apps/api on Hono (auth, groups, CQRS dispatch, web push) and apps/worker, which drains outbox_events. Data: Postgres is authoritative and Valkey is the API cache; Docker Compose also runs Traefik, MinIO, Loki, Prometheus and Grafana. Shared code: libs/domain, libs/server, libs/client and the @spy4x packages on JSR." width="860">

## Why template

- **Tenancy from day one.** Every user gets a group at sign-up; every group uses the same IDs,
  membership checks and roles, from viewer to owner. A group can be renamed, deleted and, for 30
  days, restored, and a person always keeps at least one.
- **Auth that is done.** Sign-up, sign-in, sessions and an authenticator-app second factor, with
  PBKDF2-SHA-256 password hashes. Web push subscriptions are built in too.
- **Offline-first SPA.** The SPA keeps the last notes and groups in IndexedDB (Dexie), opens with no
  network, and queues note writes with their idempotency keys. It sends them on reconnect and
  shows a stale write as a conflict to settle, never as a silent overwrite. The layer sits in one
  folder, so a product that does not want it deletes the folder and keeps an online SPA:
  [docs/offline.md](docs/offline.md).
- **Mailing lists.** Visitors subscribe at `/subscribe` with double opt-in, and every list mail
  carries a one-click unsubscribe. The worker signs the links with `SUBSCRIBERS_SECRET` and sends
  the confirm, welcome and issue mail: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#mail-subscriptions).
- **CQRS with an outbox.** Commands, queries and events go through one bus. Creating a shared
  group writes its event to `outbox_events`, and the worker drains that table.
- **Safe API defaults.** Every mutation must come from the web app's own origin, and group lists
  page with HMAC-signed cursors.
- **Built on web standards.** Hono handlers take a Fetch `Request` and return a `Response`;
  password hashes and cursor signatures use Web Crypto; live updates travel over a standard
  WebSocket; everything is an ES module. The servers run on Deno 2 in Docker on any Linux host you
  control, and the clients run in any modern browser.
- **Operations included.** Docker Compose for development and single-node production: Traefik,
  Postgres, Valkey, MinIO, Loki, Prometheus and Grafana.

**Use it if** you are starting a multi-user web product and want auth, tenancy and operations
settled before the first feature. **Skip it if** you deploy to serverless functions rather than a server
you run.

## The SPA and the MPA

The template ships two web apps over the same API, with different jobs.

- **The SPA** (`apps/spa`, Preact and Vite) is the product. Everything a signed-in person does
  happens there: sign-up and sign-in, notes, groups, billing, the profile. People see each other's
  changes live over a WebSocket ([ADR 002](docs/decisions/002-realtime-transport-and-sync.md)), and
  it works offline ([docs/offline.md](docs/offline.md)). Compose serves it at `DOMAIN`.
- **The MPA** (`apps/mpa`, Fresh) is the product's public website: the home page, pricing read
  from the `PLANS` catalog, privacy and terms pages to adapt, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml` and the
  newsletter. Every page is rendered on the server and works with JavaScript turned off. It has
  no session; its sign-in and sign-up links open the SPA at `DOMAIN`.

The MPA calls the API over HTTP from the server, only for the newsletter, and never touches the
database itself. It needs `ENV` and `DOMAIN` (the same values as the API), its own host
`MPA_DOMAIN`, and `API_URL`, the address the MPA's server reaches the API at, such as
`http://api:8000`; it refuses to start without any of them. To deploy it, set
`COMPOSE_PROFILES=mpa` in the env file (join it with other profiles by commas) and `MPA_DOMAIN` to
the website's own host, then run `deno task deploy` as usual: Compose builds the `mpa` service from
`apps/mpa/dockerfile.prod` and serves it at `MPA_DOMAIN`, next to the SPA at `DOMAIN`. The API
accepts a form only from `http(s)://DOMAIN`, so the MPA, after refusing any post that does not come
from its own pages, presents its posts to the API with `DOMAIN`'s origin. `MPA_DOMAIN` needs a DNS
record pointing at the server; Traefik gets its certificate as for `DOMAIN`. Without the profile
nothing about the deploy changes. The MPA's end-to-end test runs in CI on every pull
request, and locally with `e2e/mpa/run.sh` against a running Postgres and Valkey (see the header
of that script).

## Production certificates

The production routers ask Traefik for certificates from the resolver named by
`TRAEFIK_CERT_RESOLVER` (default `myresolver`). `infra/compose/compose.proxy.yml` defines that
resolver: Let's Encrypt, HTTP challenge on port 80, certificates stored in
`.volumes/traefik/letsencrypt/acme.json`, expiry notices to `TRAEFIK_ACME_EMAIL`. Point `DOMAIN` at
the server and run `deno task proxy:start` there.

`deno task deploy` needs no manual step on a new server: it creates `infra/configs/vapid.json`
(the web push keys) there when the file is missing, readable by its owner only. It never sends the
key from your machine and never replaces one that exists. Router, service and middleware names
carry `${PROJECT}`, so projects with different `PROJECT` values can share one Traefik. Postgres and
Valkey stay on `127.0.0.1`. Every image has a pinned version.

The template usually deploys behind a Traefik that several projects share. If that Traefik already
defines a resolver, do not start the proxy compose file: set `TRAEFIK_CERT_RESOLVER` to the name it
defines. If that Traefik defines none, copy the three `--certificatesresolvers.*` flags from
`compose.proxy.yml` into its command.

## Tasks

Current tasks come from [`deno.jsonc`](deno.jsonc).

| Task                         | What it does                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `deno task check`            | Lint, format check, type check and unit tests          |
| `deno task test:integration` | Integration tests against your Postgres and Valkey     |
| `deno task e2e`              | Playwright end-to-end tests                            |
| `deno task db:migrate`       | Apply the SQL migrations in `libs/server/db`           |
| `deno task db:reset`         | Drop, migrate and seed a dev database (`ENV=dev` only) |
| `deno task spa:build`        | Build the SPA                                          |
| `deno task subscribers:send` | Queue an issue for a mailing list (worker container)   |
| `deno task deploy`           | Copy the production files to the server and start them |

Run individual app tasks with `api:*`, `spa:*`, or `mpa:*`. Deno workspace members inherit shared
imports and tooling settings from root `deno.jsonc`.

## Development

```sh
deno task check
deno task hooks:install   # runs the checks before every commit
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the rules, and [docs/handoff.md](docs/handoff.md) for
the state of the migration and the traps in this codebase. To add a product feature, follow
[docs/aggregates.md](docs/aggregates.md): it walks through every file of the notes aggregate, in
order.
