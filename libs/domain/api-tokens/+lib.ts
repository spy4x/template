/**
 * Personal API tokens (#167): a person lets a script or another service use the API in one of
 * their groups, without their password. A token is shown once, when it is created; the server
 * keeps only a keyed hash of it. It carries a name, one group, read-only or read-write access, an
 * expiry and the time it was last used.
 *
 * A token acts as its owner, so it can do no more than the owner can in that group, and it never
 * reaches the account itself: the password, the address, deleting the account, sessions or other
 * tokens. `apps/api/routes/token-api.ts` is the only place that accepts one.
