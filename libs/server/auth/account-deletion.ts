/**
 * Deleting one's own account (#144): what stops it, the request that starts the wait, the restore
 * that a sign-in during the wait performs, and the delete for good once the wait is over.
 *
 * - **The wait.** A request soft-deletes the `users` row (the caller does that through its cached
 *   user methods, so the cache entry goes too) and writes one `account_deletions` row with
 *   `delete_after` {@link ACCOUNT_DELETION_GRACE_DAYS} days ahead, on the database clock. A
 *   soft-deleted person is already hidden from every group query and refused by sign-in.
 * - **What stops it.** A group the person owns that other active people still use, and any group
 *   of theirs whose subscription is not cancelled: deleting it would drop the others' content or
 *   leave the provider charging a card nobody can reach. The person hands the group over, removes
 *   the members or cancels the plan first. The same check runs again under row locks inside the
 *   request, and once more before the delete for good.
 * - **The delete for good.** Removes the person's owned groups (their notes, members, billing and
 *   invitations go with them), their outbox rows, then the auth user. Everything else that pointed
 *   at the person either goes with the auth user (keys, sessions, profile, settings, push devices,
 *   audit rows) or is emptied (authors of notes, who added a member, who acted in a group's audit
 *   log), so content in shared groups stays, by "Deleted user".
 *
 * Reads no environment and imports no singleton: the API and the worker both use it.
 *
