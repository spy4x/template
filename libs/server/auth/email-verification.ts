/**
 * Proving an e-mail address with a one-time code (#140): where an account's address stands, the
 * address change that waits for its code, and the one check that later features ask before they
 * trust an address.
 *
 * The codes are `createEmailProof`'s from `@spy4x/server/auth/email-code`: 48 random bits as 8
 * base64url characters, bound to the user and the address, stored only as a SHA-256 of both and the
 * code, 5 guesses per code, 10 minutes, deleted when they match. Each user and address pair keeps
 * its own guess count, so another account asking to prove the same address cannot spend this
 * account's guesses. The store compares the hashes with SQL `=`; the time that takes tells a guesser nothing
 * about the code, since they would need a preimage of the hash. Asking again replaces the code and
 * keeps its guess count, so asking never buys more guesses.
 *
 * Reads no environment and imports no singleton: the API and the worker both use it.
 *
 * @module
