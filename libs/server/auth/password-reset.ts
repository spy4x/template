/**
 * Password reset by e-mail link: the codes, their lifetime and the link that carries them.
 *
 * The code lives in `auth_challenges` (`@spy4x/server/auth`), which stores only its SHA-256 hash,
 * keeps one live code per address, counts wrong guesses and deletes the code when it matches, so a
 * link works once. The worker issues the code and mails it in the same step, so the raw code is
 * never written anywhere: not in Postgres, not in the job queue, not in a log.
 *
 * A code is 256 random bits. The store compares hashes with SQL `=`; the time that takes tells a
 * guesser nothing about the code, since they would need a preimage of the hash (the store's own
 * note on `attemptChallenge` says the same).
 *
 * Reads no environment and imports no singleton: the API and the worker both use it.
 *
