/**
 * The billing half of a transfer of ownership (#250), run in the transfer's transaction after the
 * group row is locked.
 *
 * - A subscription that still renews refuses the transfer (`SUBSCRIPTION_RENEWS`): the old owner
 *   cancels it in the billing portal first, so their card is never charged again for a group they
 *   no longer own. A subscription cancelled at its period's end, or one that has ended, passes.
 * - The group's provider customer, and the held subscription's, are recorded as handed over, for
 *   good: the app opens no portal for them any more, so the new owner never sees the old owner's
 *   card, address or invoices, and the new owner's checkout makes a customer of their own. None of
 *   their subscriptions takes the group back, seat changes skip them, and their notices go to the
 *   owner recorded here.
 *
 * The provider is not called: nothing here can charge anyone, and nothing needs to be undone if the
 * transfer rolls back.
