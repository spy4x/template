-- #147: the in-app inbox. One row is one thing the app tells a person: an invitation, a role
-- change, a removal, a group handed to them. The row is written in the transaction of the change it
-- tells about, so it exists exactly when the change does. `payload` holds the few facts the
-- sentence needs, never a note body or an address. `link` is the in-app page the notification is
-- about. A row of a deleted account goes with the account; a read row is deleted by the worker's
-- nightly cleanup 90 days after `read_at`.
