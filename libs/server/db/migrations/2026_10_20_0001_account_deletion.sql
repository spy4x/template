-- #144: a person deletes their own account. The request soft-deletes `users` at once (every group
-- query already hides a soft-deleted person) and waits 7 days in `account_deletions`; signing in
-- before `delete_after` removes the row and restores the account. A worker job then removes the
-- auth user for good, and the database removes or empties everything that pointed at it.
--
-- One row per user: a second request while one waits is refused by the unique key. The row hangs
-- off `auth_users`, so the hard delete takes it along with everything else.

-- table while holding the lock that blocks writes.
