 * Records everything the browser refuses under a page's content security policy, in every page of

 * refusal, naming the directive, what was blocked and the page. A spec walks the app and then
 * expects the list to be empty.
 *
 * Two sources feed it. The page's own `securitypolicyviolation` event covers what a document
 * loads or runs. Chromium's console message covers a page whose JavaScript is turned off, where no
 * listener can run.
