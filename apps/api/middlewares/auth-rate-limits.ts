/**
 * Build the auth rate limits over the stores `settings.store` builds. In production that is Valkey
 * through the atomic `createRedisRateLimitStore`, so every budget survives an API restart or
 * deploy, and any number of API instances share one exact budget per client. Compose runs Valkey
 * without persistence (`--save ""`), so restarting Valkey itself still empties every budget. Compose
 * also runs Valkey with `--maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru`, so under memory pressure a budget may be
 * evicted like any cached key; a budget under attack is touched on every attempt and is the last to
 * go, and the Postgres failure counter still bounds one-time-code guesses.
 *
 * When Valkey fails, the strict, one-time-code, reset and code-mail limits refuse the request (the
 * error reaches Hono's error handler, which answers 500): they stand between an attacker and a
 * password, a six-digit code or someone else's inbox, and letting attempts through unseen is the
 * attack they exist to stop. The normal
 * limit lets the request through and reports the error through `settings.onStoreError`, so sign-out
 * and `/me` keep working while Valkey is down, as the rest of the signed-in API does. The normal
 * limit uses `failOpenLimiter` for that; the others must never be wrapped in it. A correct
 * one-time code whose slot cannot be given back keeps its response (the session cookie included),
 * and the slot stays spent; that error is reported through `settings.onStoreError` too.
 *
 * Shared budgets, on purpose: sign-in, sign-up and both halves of a password reset from one IP
 * spend one strict budget, since each guesses or probes an account. Asking for a reset link also
 * spends the address's own budget (`resetByAddress`), so many IPs together still cannot flood one
 * inbox. `/totp/check` and `/totp/connect/finish` spend one user's one-time-code
 * budget, so switching routes buys no extra guesses. The e-mail address routes (asking for a code,
 * checking one, changing the address) spend the user's strict budget. A code mail to the account's
 * own address also spends that address's budget (`emailCodeByAddress`). A code mail to an address
 * the account wants to move to spends the account's budget (`emailChangeByUser`) and a separate
 * budget of that address for change mails (`emailChangeByAddress`) instead: the address may be
 * someone else's, and a stranger must not run its owner's budget out, while many strangers
 * together still cannot flood it. Every other auth route spends one normal budget per user, else
 * per IP. Each route mounts its limiter after its cross-site check, so a
 * refused cross-site request spends nobody's budget.
 *
 * The one-time-code limit is separate because a six-digit code is a small secret: one random guess
 * succeeds about once in 333,000 tries, so it needs far fewer attempts per day than a password.
 * Only wrong codes spend it (`skipSuccessful`), so a user who signs in six times in one window is
 * never refused. The failure counter in `services/totp-failures.ts` lives in Postgres and is what
 * limits guesses over days and years.
 *
 * Proxy assumption: the client IP comes from `X-Real-IP` because Traefik alone sits in front of the
 * API and overwrites that header on every request. The connection's own address, which
 * `deno serve` hands Hono as `env.remoteAddr`, is the fallback. `CF-Connecting-IP` and
 * `X-Forwarded-For` are not trusted: Traefik passes them through unchanged. Two setups break this.
 * Any container on the shared `proxy` network reaches the API directly and can forge `X-Real-IP`.
 * Behind Cloudflare's proxy, Traefik sets `X-Real-IP` to a Cloudflare address, so users share
 * budgets per Cloudflare edge instead of per client.
