 * anonymous message fails loudly the first time it runs. Forgetting to guard a user-facing one
 * fails silently, in production, as a missing authorization check.
 *
 * Exemptions are listed in one place, the app's `sessionGate` below, so the whole authorization
 * posture can be read in one screen and reviewed as a diff when it changes.
 *
 * Exempted messages are anonymous by construction: sign-in before a session exists, or a worker
 * draining the outbox. A guarded message that arrives without an actor is a wiring bug, not an
 * anonymous request, so it is rejected rather than waved through.
 *
 * An actor built from a personal API token (`actor.token`) passes only for the messages in
 * `tokenMessages`, in the token's group, and only for reads when the token is read-only
 * (`./token-scope.ts`).
