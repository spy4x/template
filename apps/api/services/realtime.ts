/**
 * The template's side of the realtime socket, a thin adapter over `@spy4x/realtime`.
 *
 * The socket authenticates once, at the upgrade (`routes/ws.ts`), and this class remembers which
 * session each socket belongs to. From then on:
 *
 * - **Every request is authorized again.** The session is read from the database for each frame,
 *   the {@link Actor} is built from that fresh state, and the request is dispatched on the same
 *   command and query buses REST uses, where the session gate and the group checks run. A
 *   socket therefore cannot do anything its session could no longer do over REST.
 * - **A revoked session loses its sockets.** {@link revalidate} closes with the policy code every
 *   socket whose session was signed out, expired, lost its user, or owes a second factor. It runs
 *   when a user signs out, on a timer, and before any request is served.
 * - **A group change reaches its members.** {@link notifyGroupChange} sends a sequence-stamped
 *   `change.hint` to each member's sockets. The hint carries no data; a client that is behind pulls.
 *   Who is a member is read for every hint, so a person who lost access stops getting them.
 * - **A person who loses a group is told once, and keeps the socket.** {@link notifyAccessLoss}
 *   sends them the hint of the change that took the group away, so their page reads again and
 *   drops it. The socket stays open: it still serves their other groups, and every request on it
 *   is authorized again anyway.
 * - **A user's own change reaches their other tabs.** {@link notifyUserChange} sends a hint for the
 *   profile or push devices to every socket of that user.
