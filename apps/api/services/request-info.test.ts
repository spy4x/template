/**
 * Pins which header wins when this app calls `requestInfoFromContext(c, { trustedProxy: true })`
 * — every call site in apps/api (routes/{auth,users,ws,pushNotification}.ts) passes this option
 * to keep the template's old behaviour of trusting a forwarding header.
 *
 * `trustedProxy: true` makes the package check `CF-Connecting-IP` before `X-Forwarded-For` and
 * `X-Real-IP`. This app's Traefik does not set `CF-Connecting-IP` itself — it only overwrites
 * `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Real-IP` — so a client could otherwise pick the IP this app writes to
 * `auth_audits` simply by sending that header. `infra/compose/compose.shared.yml`'s
 * `strip-cf-ip-${PROJECT}` middleware removes it at the proxy before a request ever reaches this
 * app, so `ip` below always ends up as the `X-Forwarded-For` value in production.
 *
 * This test pins the package's header precedence for the option every app call site passes. It
 * does not import a route, so it will not notice a call site dropping `trustedProxy: true`; the
 * e2e suite is what exercises the real routes.
