/**
 * The app's sign-in, wired onto `@spy4x/server/sign-in` and `@spy4x/server/auth`: sessions, the
 * session cookie, the guards, password hashing and authenticator-app codes all come from the
 * package; this file decides what the template adds on top of them.
 *
 * - **E-mail addresses, and the usernames of older accounts.** Sign-up takes an address: the
 *   package's `createPasswordSignIn` writes one `password` key whose subject and `email` are the
 *   address as `normalizeEmail` leaves it (trimmed, lower-cased), unproven. Accounts made before
 *   that signed up with a username: their key's subject is the normalised username and its `email`
 *   is null. Sign-in takes either: a login `normalizeEmail` accepts goes to the address provider,
 *   anything else to a username provider over the same keys, so an older account signs in as before.
 *   The address is attached to the key, not to `users`: nullable (older keys), unique through the
 *   key's `(method, subject)` constraint, and compared after normalisation.
 * - **Password reset by link.** `resetPassword` spends a code from `password-reset.ts`, proves the
 *   address (whoever holds the mailbox owns the account that signs in with it), sets the new
 *   password and signs out every session of the user. It signs nobody in: the person signs in again
 *   with the new password, and their second factor if they have one.
 * - **One sign-up transaction.** The auth user and key, the session, the `users` profile row (same
 *   id) and the first group are written in one `db.begin()`: the sign-up provider is built over
 *   that transaction's stores.
 * - **Authenticator app.** Secret and last accepted time step live in `user_totp`; `users.mfa`
 *   keeps its three states. An account whose address is not proven cannot turn one on: whoever
 *   squats someone else's address must not lock its owner out with a second factor (#140).
 * - **Proving the address (#140).** `verifyEmail` checks a code from
 *   `@spy4x/server/auth/email-code` and proves the address it was sent to. A reset link proves the
 *   address too; when it was unproven until then, the reset also removes any second factor, since
 *   whoever set it up never showed they own the mailbox. A new address waits in `email_changes`
 *   until its code proves it; only then does the password key move to it, so the account signs in
 *   with the old address until that moment.
 * - **Audit rows in the same transaction (#191).** Sign-up, sign-in and sign-out each write their
 *   `auth_audits` row inside the transaction that changes the session, so a failed row undoes the
 *   action. Sign-in checks the password with the package's `checkCredentials` first and creates
 *   the session itself, so the transaction holds no connection while a hash is verified.
 * - **Signed-in devices (#151).** Every new session records a device name parsed once from the user
 *   agent and the address with its last part hidden, in the transaction that creates it when there
 *   is one; requests and live sockets record when it was last used, at most every few minutes. A
 *   person lists their live sessions and ends any other one, or all others, which deletes their
 *   rows: every statement names the user, so another person's session is out of reach and looks
 *   missing. A password change ends every other session unless the person asks to keep them.
 * - **Deleting the account (#144).** `deleteAccount` soft-deletes the profile, writes the waiting
 *   request with its two jobs and signs out every session, in one transaction, after checking
 *   again under row locks that no group stops it (`@server/auth/account-deletion.ts`). A correct
 *   password during the wait restores the account before the sign-in goes on as usual, second
 *   factor included: the password alone cancels the deletion but still lets nobody in who lacks
 *   the second factor.
 *
 * Reads no environment and imports no singleton, so the integration tests construct it against
 * their own schema.
 *
