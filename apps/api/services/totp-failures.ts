/**
 * The persistent count of wrong one-time codes per user, with a lock that grows per failure (#73).
 *
 * The flow and the policy are `@spy4x/server/lockout`'s defaults: 5 free failures, then 15 minutes
 * doubling up to one day, and 7 quiet days set the count back to 0. Each check is counted before
 * the code is looked at and refunded when it was right, so parallel guesses cannot slip through.
 * This module only says where the counter lives: the `failed_attempts`, `locked_until` and
 * `last_failure_at` columns of the user's `user_totp` row.
 *
 * The in-memory rate limit in `middlewares/auth-rate-limits.ts` stops a burst and forgets
 * everything on restart. This counter lives in Postgres, so it survives a restart and a second
 * API instance sees it. Together they cap a guesser at about 570 guesses a year for one user, a
 * chance of about 0.17% of hitting one of the 3 codes that are valid at any moment (arithmetic in
 * the pull request of #73).
 *
 * @module
