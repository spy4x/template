 * Builds the `GET /` WebSocket route. This is the only place a socket is authenticated:

 *    REST request: no session is 401, and a session that still owes its second factor is 401 too.
 * 2. `Origin` must equal the web app's origin, or the upgrade is refused with 403. A browser
 *    attaches the session cookie to a socket that a page on a sibling subdomain opens, and that
 *    page can read every message; `SameSite=Lax` does not stop it, and CORS does not govern
 *    handshakes.
 * 3. The handshake names the user the page was started for, as the subprotocol `user.<id>` (a
 *    browser cannot set a header on a socket), and the session must be that user's, or the upgrade
 *    is refused with 401.
 *    A cookie can change under a running page, and a socket opened as someone else would carry the
 *    page's calls as them.
 *
 * Every later frame is authorized again by {@link Realtime}; nothing here is trusted afterwards.
