 * Routes that exist only in development, for the e2e specs and local scripts.
 *
 * Each route that names a user takes `{ login }`: what the user signs in with, an e-mail address or
 * an older account's username.
 *
 * `POST /cleanup-user` with `{ login }` deletes that user and everything that would stop the
 * delete: the groups they own or created (with their memberships, audit and outbox events), the
 * audit and outbox events they are the actor of, the notes they wrote, and the memberships they
 * granted in other groups.
 * It answers 200 when the login has no user, so a spec can call it before its own sign-up.
 *
 * `POST /add-member` with `{ login, groupId, role }` makes that user a member of a shared group
 * with the role (1 viewer, 2 editor, 3 admin), or changes the role of one who is. The product has
 * no way to add a member yet, and the notes e2e spec needs a second member of one group. It
 * answers 404 when the user or the shared group does not exist, and 409 for the group's owner,
 * whose role it never changes: a group has exactly one owner.
 *
 * `POST /close-sockets` with `{ login }` closes that user's WebSockets the way a dropped network
 * would, so an e2e spec can check that the app catches up after a reconnect. It answers with how
 * many sockets it closed.
 *
 * `POST /last-mail` with `{ email }` answers the newest mail the worker sent to that address in
 * development (`dev_mail`): `{ subject, text }`, or 404 when there is none. The e2e specs read a
 * password reset link this way.
