# Realtime transport and sync-on-reconnect

- Status: proposal, not yet decided. Becomes ADR 002 once the topology question is settled.

## The questions

1. Do WebSockets live in `apps/api`, or in their own app?
2. If their own app, what is it called?
3. How does a client catch up after reopening the app or losing and regaining a connection?

## The constraint that decides most of this

ADR 001 already fixed the important part:

> No WebSocket correctness dependency; WS may hint earlier pull but protocol must work without it.

That single line changes the shape of the answer. If WebSockets only *hint*, the realtime layer
holds no business logic, validates no commands, and owns no data. It is a fan-out of small
"group X moved to sequence N" messages. Everything that must be correct — ordering, idempotency,
conflict rejection — lives in the REST/CQRS path and is exercised identically whether or not a
socket is connected.

This is the main lesson from Financy, where the opposite choice was made: its WS service is 1232
lines because it dispatches all 19 CQRS commands, validates every model, and streams entity lists.
That makes the socket a second mutation path with its own validation and its own security surface,
and it means the app does not work when the socket is down.

## Topology: same app or separate app

**Option A — inside `apps/api`.** One auth path, one middleware chain, one deployment unit. The
handler can call the command bus in-process. Simplest thing that works, and the default most
generated projects want.

Costs: sockets are long-lived and stateful, so every API deploy drops every connection; REST and
realtime must scale together even though one scales on CPU-per-request and the other on
concurrent-connections-and-memory; and a misbehaving socket handler can add latency to REST in
the same process.

**Option B — a separate app.** Independent scaling and deploy cadence, so rolling the API does not
drop sockets. Failure isolation. Because the layer is hint-only it needs no command bus at all.

Costs: it needs its own way to authenticate the session cookie, and a cross-process channel to
learn that something changed — Valkey pub/sub, or polling `outbox_events`. That is one more
service every generated project must run and operate.

### Recommendation

**Start in `apps/api`, behind a library boundary that makes extraction cheap.**

Put the connection registry and the hint protocol in `libs/server/realtime`, and let `apps/api`
mount it. If connection counts or deploy pain ever justify it, add a second entry point that
imports the same library — the move is then a deployment change, not a rewrite.

The reasoning is that the hint-only constraint keeps this layer small, and a small stateless layer
is cheap to extract later but expensive to operate early. Shipping a mandatory second service in a
template that is meant to be copied is a real cost paid by every project, in exchange for scaling
headroom that a new project does not have yet. Deploys dropping sockets is tolerable precisely
because clients must already handle reconnect-and-resync correctly.

### Naming, when it is extracted

`apps/realtime`. It names the capability rather than the transport, so adding SSE or long-polling
later does not make the name a lie. `apps/ws-api` is the weaker option: it reads as "a second API",
which is exactly what this must not become.

## Sync on reconnect

The rule: **the socket never carries data, only the fact that data exists.**

Client state, persisted in Dexie so it survives reloads:

- `cursor` per group — the last committed `next_change_sequence` the client has applied.
- `authorizationRevision` per group — as of the last successful pull.

The flow:

1. **Cold start, no cursor for a group** — client calls the bootstrap endpoint and receives a
   snapshot plus the cursor that snapshot was taken at.
2. **Warm start or reconnect** — client calls pull with its cursors and receives ordered changes
   and new cursors. This is the same call whether it has been offline for a second or a week.
3. **Steady state** — server sends `sync.hint { groupId, sequence }` when a group advances. The
   client pulls only if `sequence` is greater than its cursor. The hint carries no payload, so a
   dropped or duplicated hint costs at most one redundant pull.
4. **Authorization changed** — if a pull reports an `authorizationRevision` different from the
   client's, that group is re-bootstrapped rather than incrementally pulled. This is what stops a
   client that was removed from a group, or downgraded, from continuing an incremental stream.
5. **No socket at all** — the client polls pull on an interval. Correctness is unchanged; only
   latency differs. This is the property ADR 001 asks for, and it is the reason this design is
   testable without a browser.

### Why not Financy's approach

Financy sends `SYNC_START` with a `lastSyncAt` timestamp and the server streams back full entity
lists per model. Three problems, all avoided above:

- **Timestamps cannot order writes.** Two commits in the same millisecond have no defined order,
  and any clock skew between application instances silently drops or repeats rows. The per-group
  monotonic sequence already in this schema has neither failure mode.
- **The checkpoint was never persisted**, so the client sends `0` and re-downloads everything on
  every connect. A cursor that does not survive a reload is not a cursor. Persisting it in Dexie is
  the whole point.
- **Data over the socket** means the sync path only works when the socket works, and it must be
  reimplemented for the offline case anyway.

## What this needs from the server

None of this exists yet; `next_change_sequence` and `authorization_revision` are currently declared
but never incremented, and `outbox_events` is written but never read.

1. Increment `next_change_sequence` on every committed group-scoped change, and record the change
   so it can be replayed in order.
2. Increment `authorization_revision` on membership and role changes.
3. Drain `outbox_events` in `apps/worker` and publish hints.
4. Bootstrap and pull endpoints.
5. The realtime library and its `apps/api` mount.

## Open questions

- Does a hint fan out to every member of a group, or only to sockets whose user is an active
  member at send time? The second is one membership lookup per hint; the first leaks the fact that
  a group changed.
- Should hints coalesce? A group under rapid writes should probably emit at most one hint per
  client per interval, since the client pulls the latest state regardless.
- Does the worker publish through Valkey pub/sub from the start? Doing so now costs little and
  removes the single-process assumption before it becomes load-bearing.

## Maintenance

When the topology question is answered, promote the decision to `docs/decisions/002-*.md`, mark
this file superseded, and leave the sync-on-reconnect detail here as the design record.
